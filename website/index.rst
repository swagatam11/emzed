*eMZed* is an open source framework for anaylising and processing LCMS
data. The framework was developed by D-BIOL (Patrick Kiefer, lab of
Julia Vorholt, Institute of Microbiology ) and Uwe Schmitt (mineway
GmbH) with several ideas in mind:

* Current frameworks and software are located on one of the following extremes: 

 * Fast and flexible frameworks, but in languages as C++ which only
   can be used by experienced programmers. Further playing with new
   ideas for analyzing data is hard due to the programming
   effort and slow edit-compile cycles.  

 * Closed black box solutions with graphical user interfaces. These
   are easy to use, but not flexible at all.

Our goal was to combine the positive aspects of both extremes: an easy
to learn framework which is flexible and allows inspection and analysis
of data either interactive or by easy to write Python scripts. This is
one of the reasons why we choose Python.

* The invention of workspace providing software as Matlab and R really
  leveraged the productivity of mathematicians and other scientists. We
  try to introduce this concept for analyizing LCMS data.

  *eMZed* is heavilly based on Spyder [spyderlib]_ for providing
  the workspace and [guiqwt]_ and [guidata]_ for plotting.

* Instead of reinventing the wheel we cherry picked algorithms from
  other frameworks and libraries. In the current version we use
  algorithms from Open-MS [openms]_ and XCMS [xcms]_.

* In order to avoid imports and exports to other software, we try to
  integrate all needed functionality in one framework
